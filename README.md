## Self-Reflection

Donald Durgan III

- **How long it took me to finish this?**
<!-- Answer below this line -->
-
I spent several hours building out the full GameHub, with most of the time going into wiring the routing, polishing the UI, integrating multiplayer logic, and writing Playwright tests. Altogether, the project took me roughly 4 hours of focused work.

- **What do you think of this completion time?**
<!-- Answer below this line -->
- 
I think the time investment was appropriate for the scope. The project required building multiple games, ensuring consistent styling, implementing multiplayer, and writing automated tests. Given all of that, the time felt well‑spent and aligned with the complexity of the assignment. But I will be sure to force myself to do them earlier

- **In hindsight, what would you do differently?**
- <!-- Answer below this line -->
- 
I would start the multiplayer integration earlier instead of saving it for later in the process.

I’d also create a shared component library sooner to avoid repeating UI patterns across games.

Finally, I’d plan my test selectors from the beginning so Playwright integration would be smoother.
